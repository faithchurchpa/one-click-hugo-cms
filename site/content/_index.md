blurb:
  heading: What is faith?
  text: >-
    Faith is a way of life freed from the tyranny of independence, self-trust,
    self-love, self-satisfaction and made dependent on God for revelation,
    guidance, meaning, worth and empowerment.


    Most importantly, our faith is in the Gospel of Jesus Christ. The gospel is: we are more sinful and lost than we ever dared admit, but through relationship with Jesus, we are more accepted and loved than we ever dared hope. This Gospel is wisdom from God because it frees us from the tyranny of self-protection, making us honest about ourselves, others and the world, and enabling real change to begin in our lives.
intro:
  heading: Soli Deo Gloria
  text: Therefore, our faith unites us together in a community of sinners in
    process together, which is the church. Together, we experience the Spirit of
    God working through and with one another, spurring us on to love and good
    deeds, to the glory of God alone.

    text: Music is one of God’s greatest gifts to His people – a powerful vehicle
      for uniting the mind and heart in praise to Him. We desire our music to be
      God-centered, truth-centered, faith-inspiring, and experiential.

    text: How do we minister to young children during the morning worship service?
      We welcome them to sit with the grown-ups to sing, pray, read the Bible,
      and listen to the sermon if you’d like. We also provide a time of
      child-friendly worship during the sermon.
